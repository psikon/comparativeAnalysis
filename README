taxonomical.analysis 

This project is part of my PhD thesis consisting of a taxonomical analysis for 
whole DNA dataset. It is based on a Blast seach improved by taxonomical annotations, 
provided by metaR and depending packages. 


The project contains functions to convert and import the taxonomical annotated 
metagenomic data into a phyloseq object, improved by some own developed functions.

The main aim of this project was the elucidation of the microbiome and metagenome 
of host-associated metagenomic data.
